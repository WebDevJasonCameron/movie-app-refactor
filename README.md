# Movie App Refactor
## Groundwork
Hello, this is where I am refactoring a group project. Here is the things we accomplished during the two days:
1. Called API data to a web page as individual dynamic cards
2. Created a feature to add new movie objects to the API, which was immediately presented in the browser (without reloading the page)
3. Provided a Delete feature to delete any movie object (card) from the API.  Again, this updated in the browser without the need to refresh the page
4. Some bootstrap design was given to the overall web page
5. A modal feature was started with the expectation that it would be used to modify existing movie object data

## Additional Features and Refactoring
Ongoing work plans on the project are as follows (not exactly in order):
1. Finish movie modification feature
2. Refactor display of movie data as animated cards
3. Refactor movie card display as a Carousel 
    A. Timed transitional slide of each card (BONUS: Center image with details... opposing side with only the movie poster)
    B. Carousels grouped in three cats: 1) Favorites, 2) Awaiting to Watch, 3) Classics
4. Include access to IMDB API 
    A. Incorporate a search for those movies in IMDB
    B. Auto add the information into this API
5. Add an amazing (personal animated) loader
6. Add the menu-bar with "Over-the-Moon-Movies" (TD) branding, search and filter feature
7. Include a footer with TD and contact information
