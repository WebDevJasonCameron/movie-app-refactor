# Movie App Refactor

## Synopsys
The Movie Project was created using a movie API on glitch that allows users to search movie titles, add new movie cards to the database, and edit title/description/genre of different movies. Together with another partner, we developed this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and ajax requests.  Currently, I am refactoring the project to include REACT.  

## Groundwork
The following are the tasks we were asked to accomplished in less than two days:
- [X] 1. Call API data to a web page as individual dynamic cards
- [X] 2. Create a feature to add new movie objects to the API, which must immediately be presented in the browser (without reloading the page)
- [X] 3. Provide a Delete feature to delete any movie object (card) from the API.  Again, this updated in the browser without the need to refresh the page
- [X] 4. Utilize bootstrap designs for the overall web page design

## Refactor Plans
Ongoing work plans on the project are as follows (not exactly in order):
- [] 1. Finish movie modification feature
- [] 2. Refactor display of movie data as animated cards
- [X] 3. Refactor movie card display as a Carousel 
    A. Timed transitional slide of each card (BONUS: Center image with details... opposing side with only the movie poster)
    B. Carousels grouped in three cats: 1) Favorites, 2) Awaiting to Watch, 3) Classics
- [] 4. Include access to IMDB API 
    A. Incorporate a search for those movies in IMDB
    B. Auto add the information into this API
- [] 5. Add an amazing (personal animated) loader
- [] 6. Add the menu-bar with "Over-the-Moon-Movies" (TD) branding, search and filter feature
- [] 7. Include a footer with TD and contact information
